              In this engaging Weather App project of mine, I embarked on a
              coding journey to develop a fully functional application that
              offers users instant access to weather updates. Utilizing APIs, I
              meticulously designed a responsive interface, ensuring users
              receive accurate forecasts for their chosen locations. Navigate
              through the app effortlessly by simply entering the name of any
              city you wish to explore and stay stylish with the trendy neutral
              latte design.

              In this very first coding project of mine, I created a basic
              landing page. During my SheCodes Workshop, I was provided with the
              challenge to create a landing page about something or someone I'm
              passionate about. The choice was obvious: My puppy-dog Charlie!
              Charlie is an bilingual Australian Labradoodle, who is navigating
              his way through a big world, as a little puppy. Explore this page
              to learn more about my dog, and view my progress on my coding
              journey.
